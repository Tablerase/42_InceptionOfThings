## Research

### Kubernetes

[Kubernetes Objects - Declarative management using config files](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/declarative-config/)

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust framework for running distributed systems resiliently, allowing for load balancing, service discovery, and self-healing capabilities.

#### K3S

- [K3S - Requirements (hardware,network,...)](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements?os=debian)
- [K3S Install Config Script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/configuration)
  - [Install Env Vars](https://docs.k3s.io/reference/env-variables)
- [ðŸ“‘ K3S Documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/)
  - [K3S Doc Agent](https://docs.k3s.io/cli/agent)
  - [K3S Doc Server](https://docs.k3s.io/cli/server)

K3S is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments and edge computing. It simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters by reducing the complexity and resource requirements typically associated with standard Kubernetes installations.

##### K3S - Flannel

Flannel is a virtual network that connects containers across multiple hosts. It is often used as a network fabric for Kubernetes clusters, providing a layer 3 network that enables pods to communicate with each other regardless of the host they are running on.

#### Ingress

> > [! NOTE]
> > Ingress dev is frozen. New features are being added to [Gateway API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/).

Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that manages external access to services within a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It provides a way to define **rules** for routing incoming requests to the appropriate services based on hostnames, paths, or other criteria.

Ingress use an **Ingress Controller** to fulfill the Ingress rules. The Ingress Controller is responsible for processing the Ingress resource and configuring the underlying load balancer or proxy to route the traffic accordingly (like ingress-nginx).

### Vagrant

- [Vagrant Install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install)
- [ðŸ“‘ Vagrant Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs)

Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtualized development environments. It allows developers to create reproducible and portable development environments using simple configuration files. Vagrant can work with various virtualization providers, such as VirtualBox, VMware, and cloud providers like AWS and Azure.

#### Vagrant File

When you use `vagrant up`, Vagrant looks for a file named `Vagrantfile` in the following order:

```bash
[home]/[current_user]/[parent_dir]/[current_directory]/Vagrantfile
[home]/[current_user]/[parent_dir]/Vagrantfile
[home]/[current_user]/Vagrantfile
[home]/Vagrantfile
/Vagrantfile
```

To create a vagrant file, simply create a file named `Vagrantfile` in the desired directory and define your virtual machine configuration using the Vagrant configuration syntax.

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"

  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y apache2
  SHELL
end
```

#### Vagrant cmds

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy
```

```bash
# Remove a VM
vagrant destroy <vm_name>
# Force removal
vagrant destroy <vm_name> --force
```

### VirtualBox

[Linux Installation](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

```bash
# List of runnings VMs
VBoxManage list runningvms
```

```bash
# Kernel-based Virtual Machine: conflict resolution - unload KVM modules
sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel kvm
```
